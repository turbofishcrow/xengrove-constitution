# XenGrove Constitution
Version 1.1, updated January 3, 2025

## Definitions
### Users
- **Normal users** are people interested in the xen community who generally participate in conversations in good faith.
- **Trolls and spammers** do not have a normal message history and break server rules with bad intentions.
- **Hacked users** have a normal message history, but suddenly became a troll/spammer.

### Elevated privileges
- **Elevated members** are moderators and councilmembers.
- **Moderators** have the following powers:
  - moderate server conversations
  - issue disciplinary action to users for rulebreaking
  - appoint and demote councilmembers
  - manage the server structure
- **Disciplinary actions** are timeouts, kicks, bans, and unbans.
- **Councilmembers** have the @council role and have access to the following channels:
  - the #council-general channel where ambiguous ban cases and other ambiguous cases are discussed and voted on; the council has access to any sensitive information that may decide bans
  - the #actions-log channel where moderator/council action, rule changes, and ownership changes are recorded
- **Ambiguous ban cases** are cases on any ban not for explicit rulebreaking (e.g. for posing a risk to server members; for persistent *borderline* rulebreaking; for creating an atmosphere undesired by the server community writ large).
- The **server owner** is the moderator with veto power, the tiebreaker vote, and the power to appoint and demote moderators.

### Moderator actions
- Mods may write normal messages to redirect a conversation or give unofficial warnings against breaking rules. These messages are not recorded in #⁠⁠actions-log unless the [mod voice] signifier is used.
- The [mod voice] signifier is used to explicitly invoke mod authority and thus should only be used for a good reason. Mod voice is wielding power, so **all uses of the [mod voice] signifier should be logged in #actions-log for transparency and accountability.**
- An official warning notifies a user that they have committed a significant offense. It should inform them that it is an official warning, with the implication that ignoring it will invoke disciplinary action and could lead to a ban. Official warnings factor into future decisions on disciplinary actions. **All official warnings and disciplinary actions should be logged.**

## Guidelines for mod actions
If a normal user makes a minor infraction with no pattern of offending, issue an unofficial warning first. The user should apologize, and may edit or delete their offending messages if necessary, unless said messages contain important information for the mod team. A mod can also break up discussions that may lead to rules being broken. If the infraction is more significant or the user has a pattern of offending or is being belligerent, an official warning should be given, which may be accompanied by a timeout of appropriate duration. Moderators should only remove messages that break server rules if they could be harmful to other users reading them. **Deleting messages counts as moderator action and should thus be logged.**

Bans should only be issued to normal users if they repeatedly break rules or if the ban is approved by a majority vote of active councilmembers. Bans for rulebreaking should be preceded by an absolute minimum of one (1) official warning for rulebreaking, perhaps more if the last official warnings were issued long ago. Multiple infractions in a quick succession of messages should count as one (1) warning, not multiple. Trolls, spammers, and alts of banned users are the exceptions; trolls include users that obviously have no interest in participating in the server constructively.

**Bans for rulebreaking must be approved by at least two (2) moderators**, and as long as a second one is not available, a moderator should at most time out the user. If any moderator objects to a ban, then it must be approved by majority vote among mods and may be reversed if the vote does not pass. **Reversals of moderator actions should also be logged.**

Any ambiguous ban cases must be brought to the #council-general channel to be discussed among mods and councilmembers. Such bans must be approved by a majority vote among active elevated members, with the owner as the tiebreaker vote. If a ban is not approved but pertains to borderline rulebreaking, an official moderator warning can be issued, which must be recorded. (Any ban case may be brought to the council if unclear.)

All bans and unbans must be recorded in #actions-log, with the names of the moderators and councilmembers supporting the action.

## Appointing and demoting elevated members
Mods are held to a higher standard of behavior than other users. If it is found that a mod's behavior merits an official warning, the offending mod will likely also be stripped of their mod powers. Cases on demoting a mod, in edge cases, should go to the council.

Councilmembers may be appointed by mods if they are trusted by the council, have a record of helpfulness to the mod team, and can be trusted with sensitive information. They may be demoted for persistent or serious misbehavior, if approved by the remaining councilmembers.

All council votes, as well as appointments and demotions for elevated members, should be recorded in #actions-log along with their supporters.

## Ownership transfers
All standards for moderator behavior apply especially to the owner, who must be willing to transfer ownership to a more suitable moderator if they do not meet these requirements:
- not to contribute to server tensions or drama
- to resolve moderator and council disputes in a fair manner
- to be both consistently level-headed and available
- to have minimal risk of abusing mod powers

As the server owner is a single point of failure, a new owner must be chosen especially cautiously. Any ownership transfer hence requires support from at least two-thirds of the active non-owner elevated members. Votes should be based on whether the new owner would satisfy the above criteria. Any server ownership transfer and its supporters should be recorded in #actions-log.

## Rule changes
**These rules will remain in effect until new ones are approved.** Server-wide rule changes require majority support among active moderators excluding the owner; changes to the Constitution require support from at least two-thirds of the active elevated members excluding the owner. The owner does not vote, but can veto the rule change. Minor additions or clarifications to the rules only need majority support from active moderators. Record every rule change and its supporters in #actions-log.

Whenever the Constitution is updated, the version number and the GitHub repository https://github.com/turbofishcrow/xengrove-constitution should be updated as well. Increment the minor version (the number after the period) for changes that do not require council approval; increment the major version (the number before the period) for changes that do. For every update, record the reason and supporters in #actions-log and the repository's changelog.
